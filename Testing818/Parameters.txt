example:instance 818_10_0_0_95

refers to a 818-node problem with ten facilities, the congestion type based on the number of clients (0 for queue size, 1 for waiting time) here 0, the congestion parameter (number of clients b on the queue) and the minimum probability α, in percentage value.
The rate parameter μ is fixed at 96 for 818-node network. 
The parameter fi that appears in formulations (1)–(7), (11)–(16) and (17)–(24) is calculated as:
fi=f*demand(i)
for 818-Dataset f=0.01

Therefore,
for 818_10_0_0_95 instance:
     
μ = 96
b = 0
α = 0.85
fi=0.01*demand(i)
